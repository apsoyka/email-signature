This repository contains the assets and code used to generate my personal email signature. The toolchain used is React and NodeJS, the signature is generated using static rendering, and the code is written in Typescript.

I decided to open-source this software for the benefit of anyone else who wished to create an email signature using React. Have fun!

To build the HTML signature file, execute `npm run build` in your terminal of choice, and to clean up, run `npm run clean`.
